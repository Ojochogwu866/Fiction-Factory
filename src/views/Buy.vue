Battù is the Wolof word for begging bowl which, by extension, also means beggar(s). As the English title tells us, this book is about beggars.
            The book is set in a large town which is clearly Dakar. The newspapers have been loudly proclaiming against what they call the human detritus, who are to be found everywhere in the town, i.e. the large amount of beggars. They must, according to the newspapers, be got rid of. They pester people when they are stopped at traffic lights and
            as they come in and out of shops, offices and banks, and, worst of all, they are driving away the tourists, whose money the country needs.</p>
